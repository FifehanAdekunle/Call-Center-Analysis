**Project Title: Call Center Analysis for October 2020**

**Project Description**:
In this project, I have created a comprehensive Call Center Analysis utilizing Excel for data cleaning and visualization. The primary objective of this project is to provide actionable insights and facilitate informed decision-making within the Call centers. By leveraging Excel, I have successfully transformed raw call center data into a user-friendly, interactive dashboard with filters for call days and centers that empower stakeholders to make decisions with valuable insights.

**ðŸ“Š Summary of Key Findings: Insights from Call Center Analysis ðŸ“Š**

**Calls by Channel:** There was a total of 3291 callers, most of these callers preferred to lodge their complaints through the call centers with 10,639 callers taking 32% of the channels of calls, the rest of the callers were relatively distributed between chat boxes, emails, and web.

**Calls by Center:** The most dominant call center is Los Angeles/CA followed by Baltimore/MD, while Chicago/IL and Denver/CO call centers had the lowest number of calls.

**Calls by Reason:** Among a total of 32,941 calls, Billing Question was the most common reason, accounting for 71% of calls (23,462), followed by Payments at 14% (4,749), and Service Outage at 14% (4,730). The rest were distributed across various other reasons. The call center needs to focus on streamlining billing processes to reduce Billing Question calls (71%).

**CALLS BY RESPONSE TIME:** In my analysis: 4,168 (Above SLA) calls exceeded response time expectations. 8,148 calls (Below SLA) were answered faster than expected. The majority, 20,625 calls (Within SLA), met response time standards which will enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.
Some Recommendations:

**Prioritize Within SLA Calls**: Maintain consistent service quality for the majority of calls.
Optimize Calls Below SLA: Ensure quick responses without compromising quality.
Address Calls Above SLA: Investigate and improve response times for these calls to enhance efficiency.

**CALLS BY SENTIMENT:** My analysis of call sentiment reveals that the majority of calls fall under the "Negative" and "Neutral" categories, with 11,063 and 8,754 calls, respectively. "Positive" and "Very Positive" sentiment calls totaled 3,928 and 3,170, while "Very Negative" sentiment calls accounted for 6,026.
Recommendation: To improve overall customer satisfaction and the call center's image, consider focusing efforts on addressing the concerns and issues raised in "Negative" and "Very Negative" sentiment calls, while also maintaining the quality of service in "Neutral" and "Positive" sentiment interactions. Departmental Gender Distribution: While gender distribution across departments is balanced, there's generally a higher number of male employees across the organization.

**SENTIMENT BY CALL CENTER:** The sentiment distribution by call center location highlights varying patterns, with Baltimore/MD having the highest number of "Negative" sentiment calls, Chicago/IL displaying mixed sentiment types, Denver/CO showing a balanced distribution, and Los Angeles/CA consistently receiving a high volume of calls across all sentiment categories. 
This information can guide targeted strategies and resource allocation for each location to enhance customer satisfaction and service quality. 

**GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF CALLS:** My analysis of calls by state highlights varying call volumes across different states in the dataset. Texas had the highest call volume with 3,572 calls, followed by California with 3,631 calls. Meanwhile, states like Vermont and Maine had relatively low call volumes, with 14 and 16 calls, respectively. Understanding these geographical differences can help allocate resources effectively and address specific customer needs in each state.
**Note:** I wanted to display 'Calls by State' on a map chart instead of a clustered bar chart, but I lacked the necessary Excel version to do so. I will update this as soon as I get my hands on that.
